# Getting Started with Timer React app

- built a react app using react concepts like state and useEffect for practice
- used state for managing data of hour, minute, seconds and boolean value which will change the start and stop button as the boolean state is changed.
- every time any of the state is changed useeffect mounting stage will be done.
